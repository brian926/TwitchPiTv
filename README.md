# TwitchPiTv
 
Creating an application to watch Twitch Streams in a TV style way on a Raspberry Pi.

The goal for this project is to recreate a "TV like style" of live Twitch streamers. While running on a Raspberry Pi that is connected to a spare monitor, we can watch live streams and flip back and forth through them like an actual TV. 
Streams are present in order of views.
Current build uses VLC to play streams.
